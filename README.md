This is a few files that might be useful. Use at own risk.

In `scripts` are scripts that are intended for others to use. 
In `examples` are examples of their use. 
To replicate examples, download 
`archives_examples_data.zip` from `https://osf.io/xdv8s/files/`
to this directory, and run `make unpack` to run the `Makefile` to
extract the datasets. Then, it should pretty much just work.
